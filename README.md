## Solidity Basics - My First Smart Contract 
- This project is my first hands on experience with Solidity and smart contract development. It focueses on understanding Solidity syntax, writing functions and methods and deploying a smart contract to a local Ethereum network.
- Through this project, I have learned how smart contracts work, how data is stored on chain and how to interact with contracts after deployment.

## What I have learnt:
- Solidity syntax and data types
- Writing functions(view,pure,public)
- State variables and visibility
- Deploying a smart contract
- Interacting with deployed contracts
- Basic Ethereum concepts(gas,transactions,addresses)
- Gas optimization

## Smart Contract Overview
- The SimpleStorage contract allows a user to store and retrieve a number on the blockchain. It demonstrates how state variables are stored on-chain and how functions can modify and read blockchain data.

## How to Deploy & Run
- The contract can be deployed using Remix IDE by compiling the contract and deploying it to a test network

## Final Note 
- This project marks my first step into smart contract development and web3. It is helping me to build a solid foundation in solidity and gives me confidence to build more complex decentralized applications.
